What are the types of data available to you?
I'm using the Twitter API (called through python) on recent tweets that contain the term "affordable care act"  it looks like there is mainly .json data available to me about user status

For data sets: how many records are in the data set? Using API, see below

For API: what are the limits on fetching data? I can only pull 100 tweets for each request and only 350 tweets with my api key.

Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is interesting: 
"4.26838E+17	1/24/14 22:04 Source: Friends + Me #Breaking: The Supreme Court is granting a temporary reprieve from the Affordable Care Act... http://t.co/uNk7tVWo1o http://t.co/zWCBoWoifY	0	affordable care act"
This is an interesting record because it is not just a retweet of the Politico tweet, like most of the records in my data, but this tweet comes from an usual source: Friends+Me instead of TwitterWeb, or Twitter for iPhone like many of the other tweets.


What are 3 questions you could answer using your data? Who is talking about the Supreme Court's recent move? How those users related to one another, both spatially and in terms of user connections. I would also like to know about how the main tweet coming through politico diffused through social networks.
