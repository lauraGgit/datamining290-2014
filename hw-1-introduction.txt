I am taking this class because as a student of public policy I think there is a huge missed opportunity to process a lot of the data that is being generated. With my interest in Health Policy, I am especially interested in looking at some of the data created by the state insurance exchanges and HealthCare.gov.  I feel like this class will complement our existing econometrics classes.
